                <h3>Vidya Foundation to provide relief during Covid-19</h3><hr>
                <p>The Embassy of Israel partnered with Vidya Foundation to help and support underprivileged communities during the Covid-19 pandemic. The objective of the drive was to spread light and joy into the lives of the families from the underprivileged communities ahead of Hannukah, the Jewish festival of lights.

                    Daily wage earners such as factory workers, construction workers, laborers and street vendors were given sanitizers and masks under the collaboration with Vidya Foundation to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.
                    
                    Vidya Foundation has worked extensively on ground during the pandemic to provide dry ration and sanitation kits to the underprivileged communities living in remote areas and urban slums. More than 20 million meals have been provided so far.</p>

                <h3>Wall of Knowledge</h3><hr>
                <p>While the pandemic has been difficult for everyone, children have been the most affected during this time. The closing down of schools and staying at home and transition to virtual classrooms has impacted their mental well being. For millions of underprivileged children it has been more difficult as they have limited or no access to digital learning. For these children education has come to an abrupt halt. As per UNICEF data, over 76% children in India are on the wrong side of the digital divide.

                    In this adverse scenario, the Vidya Foundation team has been trying its best to help the less privileged children continue their education. From home visits to distributing worksheets and study material from door to door, from using alternate modes like television and radio to conducting cluster classes facilitated by community volunteers, different methods are being explored to ensure that education does not stop for the children despite the pandemic.</p>

                <p>With the economic distress and ongoing lockdown, Vidya Foundation is distributing free ration to the underprivileged communities in rural areas and urban slums. More than 20 million meals have been distributed across 22 states of India.</p>
